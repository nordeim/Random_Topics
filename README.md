Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants a detailed comparison of Intel and Nvidia's stock performance, but the search results are heavily skewed toward Nvidia. First, I'll extract all relevant data for Nvidia from the provided sources. Historical prices, EPS, P/E ratios, and dividend yields are all there. For Intel, there's almost nothing except buyback data, which isn't directly related to share price trends. 

Hmm, this is a problem. The user asked for a comparison, but the sources don't give Intel's metrics. Maybe I should highlight that the analysis is limited by data availability. Still, I can infer Intel's challenges from Nvidia's dominance in AI and data centers. The buyback info for Intel shows reduced activity post-2021, which might indicate financial caution or strategic shifts, but without revenue or EPS data, it's speculative.

Nvidia's growth is explosive: 171% stock increase in 2024, revenue doubling YoY, and insane P/E ratios. Their AI focus is paying off. Intel, as a traditional CPU maker, is likely struggling to keep up. I'll structure the report to focus on Nvidia's strengths and note Intel's lack of visible momentum. 

Key metrics for Nvidia: EPS growth from $0.34 (2022) to $2.53 (TTM), P/E around 54, tiny dividend. Intel's absence in the data suggests they're not the star here. The recommendations will lean heavily on Nvidia's upward trajectory, while cautioning about Intel's uncertain position. Need to cite all Nvidia data properly and mention Intel's data gaps.
