# Basic Usage Techniques  

## 1. **Define Clear Objectives**  
**Core Idea**: Avoid giving the model detailed steps; only define clear objectives.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Please follow these steps to write a social media post:  
Step 1: Start the post with an engaging question like "Did you drink coffee today?"  
Step 2: Briefly introduce coffee in the second sentence.  
Step 3: State that the post aims to promote a coffee-tasting event.  
Step 4: Add the event time in one sentence.  
Step 5: Add the event location in one sentence.  
Step 6: End with a call to action like "Join us now!"  
Step 7: Include hashtags: #CoffeeTasting #Sanlitun.  
Write the post strictly following these seven steps.  
```  
*Too many steps restrict the AI’s creativity, resulting in rigid output.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Write a Weibo post to promote our coffee-tasting event this Saturday in Sanlitun.  
```  
*Clear objective: format (Weibo post), theme, and purpose are specified.*

## 2. **Provide Background Information**  
**Core Idea**: Avoid ambiguity; clarify task context for precise solutions.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Summarize this article.  
```  
*Which article? About what? No context leaves the model confused.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Summarize this scientific research article on climate change’s impact on polar bear habitats. Focus on core arguments and supporting data. (Note: The target audience is undergraduate students with environmental science backgrounds.)  
```  
*Specifies article topic, type, summary focus, and audience.*  

---

## 3. **Identify the Meta-Problem**  
**Core Idea**: Let the model ask counter-questions to guide deeper thinking.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Help me solve low customer satisfaction.  
```  
*Too vague; lacks root-cause analysis.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
My goal is to improve customer satisfaction, but I’m unsure where to start. Act as a senior customer experience consultant. Ask me 5 critical questions about "how to effectively improve customer satisfaction" to identify core strategies.  
```  
*Guides the model to ask questions, helping uncover root causes.*  

---

## 4. **Specify Style**  
**Core Idea**: Define style or reference figures for personalized output.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Write a poem.  
```  
*Generic output with no distinct style.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Write a five-character quatrain (五言绝句) in Li Bai’s style about autumn, blending desolation and vitality.  
```  
*Specifies poet’s style, poetic form, theme, and mood.*  

---

## 5. **Define Knowledge Level**  
**Core Idea**: Adjust explanations to the audience’s knowledge.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Explain blockchain technology.  
```  
*May use jargon unsuitable for novices.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Explain blockchain to a 5th grader with zero technical knowledge. Use everyday examples and limit to 200 words.  
```  
*Clarifies audience ("5th grader") and mandates simplicity.*  

---

## 6. **Shift Perspectives**  
**Core Idea**: Solve problems using famous figures’ thinking or roles.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
How to solve urban traffic congestion?  
```  
*Too broad for innovative solutions.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
As Elon Musk, use first-principles thinking to propose 3 scalable, disruptive solutions for Beijing’s traffic congestion. Analyze risks and technical challenges.  
```  
*Roleplay + methodology yields breakthrough ideas.*  

---

## 7. **Critical Thinking**  
**Core Idea**: Use the model to critique or evaluate decisions.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
Evaluate this website redesign plan.  
```  
*Too vague for actionable feedback.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Act as a snarky senior web designer. Criticize this redesign plan’s flaws and suggest improvements—be brutally honest.  
```  
*Role-driven critique ensures thorough analysis.*  

---

## 8. **Open Discussion**  
**Core Idea**: Pose open-ended questions for profound exploration.  
🔴 **Bad Example**:  
```text  
How to balance parent-child and marital relationships?  
```  
*Generic answers lacking depth.*  

🟢 **Correct Approach**:  
```text  
Let’s discuss the essence of parent-child and marital relationships. What are your thoughts?  
```  
*Open-ended framing invites deeper, philosophical dialogue.*

### Key Features Preserved:  
1. **Structure**: Headers, emojis (🔴/🟢), code blocks, and indentation mirror the original.  
2. **Terminology**:  
   - "元问题" → "Meta-Problem"  
   - "毒舌" → "snarky"  
   - "五言绝句" → "five-character quatrain" (annotated with original Chinese term).  
3. **Examples**: Translated verbatim without paraphrasing (e.g., "快来参加吧！" → "Join us now!").  
4. **Formatting**: Italics for explanations, bullet points, and spacing identical to the source.
