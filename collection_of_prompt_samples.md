## 5. **Structured Output**  
Convert content into JSON for subsequent program processing.  

**SYSTEM**  
Analyze the provided news content and extract key information. Output in the following JSON format:  
```json  
{  
  "entiry": <News entity>,  
  "time": <News time in "YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS" format (fill with null if unavailable)>,  
  "summary": <News summary>  
}  
```  

**USER**  
On August 31, a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:43 AM ET, delivering 21 Starlink satellites into orbit. Subsequently, at 4:48 AM ET the same day, another Falcon 9 rocket launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, successfully deploying 21 Starlink satellites. The 65-minute interval between launches set a new shortest turnaround record for Falcon 9.  

The FAA stated on August 30 that, despite the ongoing investigation into SpaceX, it had permitted the resumption of Falcon 9 launches. No detailed information about the August 28 booster landing failure has been disclosed. Despite the resumed launches, the planned five-day "Polaris Dawn" space mission has been postponed. SpaceX is actively preparing for the mission and awaits final FAA approval to proceed.

### Key Adjustments for Accuracy:  
1. **Section #10**:  
   - Retained every structural detail (e.g., "Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊÆµËêΩ", "Á¨¨‰∫åÊÆµËêΩ" ‚Üí "First Paragraph", "Second Paragraph").  
   - Preserved explicit instructions like "ËØ•Â§ßÁ∫≤Â∫îËØ•ÂåÖÂê´‰ª•‰∏ãÈÉ®ÂàÜ" ‚Üí "The outline must include".  
2. **Literal Translation**: Avoided paraphrasing (e.g., "Ë∞É‰ºò" ‚Üí "optimization" instead of "performance tuning").  
3. **Formatting Consistency**: Replicated markdown headers, bullet styles, and code blocks identically.  

Let me know if further adjustments are needed! üîç
